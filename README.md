# Job-Map header

A free and open source job finding app that shows job adverts on a map based on their location, a feature currently missing from all main UK job websites.
As well as displyaing jobs on a map, they can also be saved to a personal map to look into job location trends near you. 

[Go to app](http://github.com)

## How to use the app header
Search for jobs using the search bar provided, jobs that match your search will be displayed on a map. 

Creating an account will give access to the most powerful feature; saving jobs to your own personal map.
*Creating an account only requires an email & password, no spam will be spent and your email is not used for anything, this is simply in order to save your job lists in a way that you can access from anywhere*
This will let you keep track of jobs you are interested in and spot trends in the location of new job opportunities, for example do most jobs require you travel North from your home city or are there jobs close to the new house you are looking at moving to etc.

## Upcoming features header
This app is built and maintained by me personally, so updates take time, however if you would like to contribute or spot any errors please get in touch.

* Reduced search time
* Multiple job title search - Search for 2 or more job titles concurrently to reduce number of searches

## Built with header
* Ruby on rails
* SQlite
* Javascript
* Google maps API
* Totaljobs

In the backend Jobs are scraped from Totaljobs, as this currently has highest number of job adverts. All job links direct back to Totaljobs so that all interactions with job adverts is still done through TotalJobs. This app is not intended to take traffic from Totaljobs, merely provide an alternative view of the adverts and add new job trend features.
